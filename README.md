1. Purpose of the project
    The purpose of this project is to create my first milestone project to demonstrate to employers that I can skillfully use HTML and CSS to create a static front end project.

    My website is inspired by the Code Institute website and other educational websites. I want it to be a site where people like me who are pivoting into the tech industry can start their journey by learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There will be hypothetical classes that will be included on the website that my instructors and I are offering classes for. I am aiming to document my journey and to provide a visual guide of learning the languages necessary to become a Full Stack Software Developer.
2. User stories

   When the user interacts with my website, I want it to elicit a positive emotional reaction. To ensure that this happens, when considering the user experience I will:

   *Make sure that my website works
   *Enusre that my website is intuitive, simple and enjoyable to use
   *Ensure that the the user experience is considered and implemented from the beginning of the website's life cycle.
   e.g I am starting with a responsive mobile first design that can then be scaled up to tablet and desktop screens. I am also making sure that my images have alternative text so that it can be accessible through screen readers.

   To guide this process, I am using Garett's theory of the 5 planes of UX design.

   Strategy: What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom?

   Scope: Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?
   What's on the table for a production release and what's not, at least for now?

   Structure: How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?

   Skeleton: How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?

   Surface: What will the finished product look like?


   External user's goals:
   New users
   Returning users
   Frequent users

   Site owner's goals:


3. Features

The key features my website will have are a navigation bar, an embedded video as an example of an online course we will offer, cards with information about instructors, a weekly schedule, a contact form page

4. Future features
Subscription feature where users can subscribe to future newsletters I write about my journey or about general relevant information about technology.

5. Typography and color scheme
6. Wireframes
I am using Balsamiq to create wireframes

# __Crochet & Coffee - Milestone Project 1__
This is the website for Crochet & Coffee, a small independent café where everyone of different abilities and backgrounds are welcome to learn how to crochet in London with the option of an expertly brewed drink. The website will allow for new and existing users to find out information such as the café's opening times, location, menu, history, crochet classes timetable and allows the users to sign up to the classes on the website.

The purpose of this project is to create my first milestone project to demonstrate to employers that I can skillfully use HTML and CSS to create a responsive and static front end website that is easy to navigate.

### __Wireframes__
Before writing any HTML or CSS, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for each of the 4 pages on the site.

- Home

![Homepage wireframe](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/homepage-wireframe.png)

- Menu

- Walk Club

![Walk club wireframe](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/walk-club-wireframe.png)

### __Colour Scheme__
I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/3c7272-242424-ffffff-ff9f55) to choose a colour scheme that would be easily readable and visually appealing to users.

![Colour Scheme](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/colour-scheme.png)

### __Typography__
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to select and import the fonts Amatic SC for main headers and the logo and Josefin Sans for body text.

![Amatic SC](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/amatic-sc.png)

## __Features__ 

### __Common Elements__

These elements appear across every page of the website as the user navigates it.

- __Logo and Navigation Bar__
    - The logo and navigation bar appears on every page of the website. Both of these have been adapted to work on various screen sizes. The logo has a link to the homepage embedded and each of the links on the navigation menu brings the user to the correct page.

### __Homepage__

This is the landing page that the user will be brought to when first entering the site.

![Homepage](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/homepage.png)

- __Information Card__
    - This card displays the café opening times, address, and contact information. The phone number and email address are both clickable to allow the user to either phone or email the café straight from the home page. The right-hand side of the card contains an image of a coffee cup with a dog on it to stick with the theme of the site. the card is adapted for smaller screens with the image appearing below the text on smaller devices.

![Information card](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/info-card.png)

- __Testimonials__
    - This section displays customer reviews, this is particularly useful for new users checking out the site who haven't visited the café before. This section is responsive with all 4 testimonials appearing on the same line on large screens, 2 across 2 lines on medium screens and individually on 4 lines for small screens.

![Testimonials](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/testimonials.png)

### __Menu Page__

This is where a user can find the café's menu along with prices.

- __Menu Image__
    - Next to the café menu is an image of two people sat drinking coffee with their dog. This is responsive as on smaller screens the image appears below the menu so as that the menu doesn't appear too small to read.

![Menu Image](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/cafe-menu-image.png)

### __About Us__

This page allows the user to get a look into the background of the café and its owners. It adds a personal feel to the site.

![About Us Page](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/about-us-page.png)

- __Meet the team__
    - This section shows an image and short bio about the two café owners and their dog. It contains three cards across on large screens and reduces to single images on smaller screens so it remains easy to read on small devices.

![Meet the Team](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/meet-the-team.png)

- __Our Journey Timeline__
    - The timeline gives users an even deeper look into the background of the café and tells the story of how the owners set up the business. The timeline boxes appear on alternating sides of the screen on large devices and in a line on the same side of the timeline bar on smaller screens to make it easily readable.

![Timeline Full](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/timeline-full.png)

![Walk Club Page](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/walk-club.png)

- __Walk Club Introductory Section__
    - The user is introduced to the walk club, it informs the user of days and times of the walks, distance and lets them know of a 50% discount on their drink if they partake in the club. This section covers 66% of the screen width on large screens but expands on smaller screens to remain looking good for the user.

![Walk Club Intro](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/happy-dog-cafe/blob/main/documentation/testing/walk-club-intro.png)
